# Overview

pyMicroeconomics is package for symbolic analysis and visualization of market equilibrium conditions with various supply and demand curve specifications. This is a wrapper of several packages such as Sympy and Matplotlib. When used interactively, it allows you to build a market equilibrium in an iterative way, starting from the demand and supply functions.

Uses:
- Define different types of supply and demand curves (linear, power, exponential, quadratic)
- Calculate market equilibrium points
- Compute consumer and producer surplus
- Visualize market equilibrium with interactive plots

## Installation

```bash
pip install pyMicroeconomics
```

This package is designed to be used interactively in a Jupyter Notebook.

## Usage Examples
